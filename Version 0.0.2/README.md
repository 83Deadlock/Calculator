This version already has a functional GUI.

To build the GUI, I used tkinter since it seemed to be quite easy to learn and put into this specific application.

Had some trouble understanding some methods but eventually came to a point where I understood what I had to do.

The next goal is to expand the calculator's mathematical abilities (exponential, percentage, rooting, etc.)
